# ConnectCare
As we get older, we want to care for our parents the same way they cared for us. But with all the demands that come along with it, this is not always possible. While the worldâ€™s ageing population continues to grow rapidly, ConnectCare will help enhance communication between all individuals involved in caring for an elderly person.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:
```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/ltan02/ConnectCare.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject/client

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
npm run start
```

Make sure you have `npm` and Node.js v10+ installed. If you don't have them yet installed, we recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

## Tools and Technologies 
### Frontend & Backend
* Frontend: React Native
* Backend: Firebase

### AI
* The artificial intelligence of ConnectCare is OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Model using the chatcompletion API

## ConnectCare's Future 
In the future, we want to further capitalize on AI to not only support but to prevent problems. We believe an AI diagnosis and auto-task generator will significantly improve correct diagnosis case and will allow medical professionals to focus on more complicated and urgent tasks. Because there would be lots and accurate data on our portal, we want to act as a central platform to ease filing insurance for eldery cares. Finally, this app is essential to be able to love, care for and respect elderly people, and ensure a supportive community around elderly care.
